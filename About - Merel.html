						<h2>About us</h2>
						<p>Hello. We’re ADAM & AOKI, a technology company dedicated to developing next generation smart clothing. We go beyond being a brand. We’re a movement revolutionising the interactions between people and everyday wear. Our innovative clothing range warns users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. Using specially developed smart fabric, our products detect dangerous UV rays and warn you via a clear colour change. The warning system also takes into account both your skin type and the time it takes you to burn, and doesn’t require phones, apps or electronics. Welcome to clothing 4.0, where functionality meets fashion.</p>

					<div class="mision">
						<h2>Mision</h2>
						<p>ADAM & AOKI is on a mission to make clothes smarter. For thousands of years we’ve focused on practically in clothing and that time has come to an end. It’s time to start wearing clothes that not only look and feel great, but also help us to overcome everyday challenges like sunburn.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="vision">
						<h2>Vision</h2>
						<p>We believe that as a business, our aim should be to try to make the world a better place. That’s why our vision is to produce sustainable smart clothing on a global scale that is specially designed to help solve millions of real-world problems, each and every day.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="science">
						<h2>The Science</h2>
						<p>Our clothing is colorchanging and linked to the erythema (sunburn) spectrum, between 290-340 nm. A delay layer is applied onto the clothing that mimicks the time it takes to get sunburned. This is durable enough to withstand multiple washes and to reproduce the delay. Our shirt can be bought for 3 types of delay based on different skintapes. Skintypes 1 & 2 need the delay of shirttype 1, skintypes 3 & 4 of shirttype 2, and skintypes 5 & 6 of shirttype 3. On the homepage of this website there is a link to roughly find out what kind of skintype you have. </p>

						<h2>What makes us ADAM & AOKI?</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>#changeit. If you’re unhappy or upset with something, be the agent of change. </li>
								<li>Transparency. No good ever came of lies and secrecy. Just ask Romeo & Juliet.</li>
								<li>Doing good. Solving real world problems is what gets us out of bed in the morning and we’d like to keep it thatway.</li>
								<li>Persevere. Let’s agree to never give up on our individual and shared challenges.</li>
								<li>Sustainability. We ❤ planet earth, but for it to keep being planet earth we need to take 	care of it.</li>
								<li>Focus on priorities and prioritise focus. All the unimportant stuff can wait.</li>
								<li>Being busy is a mindset. You’re never too busy to do something. You just didn’t make time 	for it and that’s fine with us.</li>
								<li>Be forever flexibile. If a 90 year old can do the splits what’s your excuse?</li>
								<li>Have Fun. Nothing —and we really mean nothing —should be boring. Including socks.</li>
								<li>Stay Curious. They say curiosity killed the cat but we promise it won’t kill you. Quite the opposite in fact.</li>
								<li>Sharing. We think you’re amazing and we genuinely mean it. Only thing we ask is that you share your amazingness with everyone around you.</li>

						<h2>Founder’s story</h2>
						<p>Back in the day I was a terrible teen, running riot. Football and females were pretty much my only interest, despite my parents best attempts to convince me it might be worth listening in school. <br><br>

						Fortunately I was -and luckily still am -surrounded by some amazing people. My Grandparents, who lived through WWII, were always on hand valuable and candid advice. My brother Ben, who has more often that not been a voice of reason. And there was Gerry, one of my mother’s best friend and an unofficial mentor to me.<br><br>

						I admired Gerry from the get go. A gentlemen, championing the fight against important causes like elder abuse and gay rights, and an unintended comedy genius. He was once at a ceremony with the then president Bill Clinton, and beamed as he told how hewas close enough to take great photos. He couldn’t wait to get them developed. Only problem was he’d forgotten to put film in his camera.<br><br>

						One of the first times I met him he parked his car in central London a spot that probably wasn’t meant to be parked in. Having stepped out the car, he walked over to the ticket machine. A few buttons later, the machine broke and spat out a bunch of pound coins but no ticket. He proclaimed that he thought “it would probably be ok” and proceeded to give me the change. Theact typified his unselfishness.<br><br>

						Sadly Gerry died of cancer in 2013. As a young man he had skin cancer (melanoma), developed from too much skin damage acquired from excessive sunbathing. Even though he beat skin cancer as a young man, he died of lung cancer —which was caused by melanoma cancer cells that had remained from his first battle with cancer.<br><br>

						ADAM & AOKI is for you Gerry. I hope you’d be proud.</p>
