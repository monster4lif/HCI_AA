					<h2>About us</h2>
					<p>
						Hello. We’re ADAM & AOKI, a technology company dedicated to
						developing next generation smart clothing. We go beyond being a
						brand. We’re a movement revolutionising the interactions between
						people and everyday wear. Our innovative clothing range warns
						users that they are in risk of getting sunburnt. Using specially
						developed smart fabric, our products detect dangerous UV rays and
						warn you via a clear colour change. The warning system also takes
						into account both your skin type and the time it takes you to

				<div class="mision">
					<h2>Mision</h2>
					<p>ADAM & AOKI is on a mission to make clothes smarter. For
						thousands of years we’ve focused on practically in clothing and
						that time has come to an end. It’s time to start wearing clothes
						that not only look and feel great, but also help us to overcome
						everyday challenges like sunburn.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="vision">
					<h2>Vision</h2>
					<p>
						We believe that as a business, our aim should be to try to make the
						world a better place. That’s why our vision is to produce
						sustainable smart clothing on a global scale that is specially
						designed to help solve millions of real-world problems, each and
						every day.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="science">
					<h2>The Science</h2>
					<p>
						Our clothing is colorchanging and linked to the erythema (sunburn)
						spectrum, between 290-340 nm. A delay layer is applied onto the
						clothing that mimicks the time it takes to get sunburned. This is
						durable enough to withstand multiple washes and to reproduce the
						delay. Our shirt can be bought for 3 types of delay based on
						different skintapes. Skintypes 1 & 2 need the delay of shirttype
						1, skintypes 3 & 4 of shirttype 2, and skintypes 5 & 6 of
						shirttype 3. On the
						<u onclick="ShowDiv('homepage')" style="cursor: pointer;">
							homepage</u>
						of this website there is a link to roughly find out what kind of
						skintype you have.

						<li>
							Doing good. Solving real world problems is what gets us out of

						</li>
						<li>
							Persevere. Let’s agree to never give up on our individual and

						</li>
						<li>
							Sustainability. We ❤ planet earth, but for it to keep being
							planet earth we need to take care of it.
						</li>
						<li>
							Focus on priorities and prioritise focus. All the unimportant

						</li>
						<li>
							Being busy is a mindset. You’re never too busy to do something.

						<li>
							Be forever flexibile. If a 90 year old can do the splits what’s

							around you.

					<h2>Founder’s story</h2>
					<p>
						Back in the day I was a terrible teen, running riot. Football and
						females were pretty much my only interest, despite my parents best
						attempts to convince me it might be worth listening in school.
						<br><br>

						Fortunately I was -and luckily still am -surrounded by some amazing
						people. My Grandparents, who lived through WWII, were always on
						hand valuable and candid advice. My brother Ben, who has more often
						 that not been a voice of reason. And there was Gerry, one of my
						 mother’s best friend and an unofficial mentor to me.<br><br>

						I admired Gerry from the get go. A gentlemen, championing the fight
						against important causes like elder abuse and gay rights, and an
						unintended comedy genius. He was once at a ceremony with the then
						president Bill Clinton, and beamed as he told how hewas close
						enough to take great photos. He couldn’t wait to get them
						developed. Only problem was he’d forgotten to put film in his
						camera.<br><br>

						One of the first times I met him he parked his car in central
						London a spot that probably wasn’t meant to be parked in. Having
						stepped out the car, he walked over to the ticket machine. A few
						buttons later, the machine broke and spat out a bunch of pound
						coins but no ticket. He proclaimed that he thought “it would
						probably be ok” and proceeded to give me the change. The act
						typified his unselfishness.<br><br>

						Sadly Gerry died of cancer in 2013. As a young man he had skin
						cancer (melanoma), developed from too much skin damage acquired
						from excessive sunbathing. Even though he beat skin cancer as a
						young man, he died of lung cancer —which was caused by melanoma
						cancer cells that had remained from his first battle with
						cancer.<br><br>

						ADAM & AOKI is for you Gerry. I hope you’d be proud.

							Sunburn and p53 in the onset of skin cancer
						</strong>
						<br>
						SQUAMOUS cell carcinoma of the skin (SCC) can progress by stages:
            sun-damaged epidermis, with individual disordered keratin-ocytes;
            actinic keratosis (AK), spontaneously regressing keratin-ized
            patches having aberrant cell differentiation and proliferation;
            carcinoma in situ; SCC and metastasis1–3. To understand how
            sunlight acts as a carcinogen, we determined the stage at which
            sunlight mutates the p53 tumour-suppressor gene and identified a
            function for p53 in skin. The p53 mutations induced by ultraviolet
            radiation and found in >90% of human SCCs4,5 were present in AKs.
            Inactivating p53 in mouse skin reduced the appearance of sunburn
            cells6, apoptotic keratinocytes generated by overexposure to
            ultraviolet. Skin thus appears to possess a p53-dependent
            'guardian-of-the-tissue' response to DNA damage which aborts
            precancerous cells. If this response is reduced in a single cell
            by a prior p53 mutation, sunburn can select for clonal expansion
            of the p53-mutated cell into the AK. Sunlight can act twice: as
            tumour initiator and tumour promoter.

							Update 3: Design logo
						</strong>
						<br>
						Dear Adam&Aoki-supporters,
						<br>
						Last week we had multiple meetings with our production team. As you
	          know all our products are made in Europe to reduce the impact it has
	          on the environment, and thus improve sustainability. We are positive
	          we can realize our product in a way we can be proud of it. We also
	          finaly decided on out logo. We appreciate the input you people gave
	          on the proposed design and together we came to the following
	          decision. Hereby we present our new logo:
